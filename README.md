# Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating brain disorder that affects movement, cognition, and mood. 
It currently has no known cause or cure, but symptoms can be managed through treatments. PD has 
a global impact, affecting approximately 7 million people worldwide, and this number is expected to 
reach 10 million by 2030. Recent studies have investigated the potential of protein and peptide levels 
as biomarkers for PD, influencing the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. By 
analyzing data from 1,019 patients, researchers utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA) and 
machine learning to identify changes in protein and peptide levels that could serve as valuable 
biomarkers for assessing the risk of PD. Early detection of PD is vital for effective management and 
intervention. Machine learning algorithms utilize protein and peptide levels obtained from routine 
health screenings to detect PD at an early stage by uncovering patterns and correlations that enable 
accurate predictive models for UPDRS scores. The results of the study demonstrated the association 
between several proteins and peptides and the risk of PD, significantly impacting UPDRS scores. 
Additionally, the levels of these proteins and peptides were found to be higher in individuals with PD 
compared to healthy individuals. In conclusion, while PD remains a complex disorder without a cure, 
the integration of machine learning and biomarker analysis shows promise for early detection. These 
techniques aid in the identification of PD biomarkers, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment 
strategies. Incorporating machine learning into routine screenings has the potential to transform PD 
management, facilitating timely interventions and personalized care.
